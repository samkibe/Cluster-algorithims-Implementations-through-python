### Clustering 
- refers to the mathematical and algorithmic process of grouping ‘n’ elements into ‘k’ distinct groups such that the groups so produced have more similarity among its members than among members belonging to different, distinct groups.

TASK: Implementation of clustering Algorithmns, by type.

- Centroid-based Clustering - We will do simple implementations of these algorithmns, they include, k-means, k_means++, k-medoids, k-modes et cetera
librarieskModes, kMeans

- Affinity Propagation, Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering, 
- Expectation-Maximization Clustering using GMM, 
- DBSCAN clustering Algorithm, 
- Mean-shift algorithm, 
- K-Means algorithm, 
- OPTICS, 
- Gaussian Mixture Model, and BIRCH.
